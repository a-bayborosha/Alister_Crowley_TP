        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1875</strong>Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at
            30 Clarendon Square in Royal on 12 October Leamington Spa,
            Warwickshire
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> When Crowley was 11, his father died of tongue
            cancer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong> Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity
            College, Cambridge, where he was entered for the Moral Science
            Tripos studying philosophy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1896 </strong> Crowley had his first significant mystical
            experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several
            biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias
            Churton, believed that this was the result of Crowley's first
            same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his
            bisexuality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1897</strong> Crowley travelled to St Petersburg in Russia,
            later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was
            considering a future diplomatic career there.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1898</strong> Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of
            the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group's leader, Samuel
            Liddell MacGregor Mathers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United
            States, settling in Mexico City and taking a local woman as his
            mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued
            experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's
            Enochian invocations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong> In February, Crowley and Rose arrived in
            Cairo. Claiming to be a prince and princess.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905 </strong> On 28 July, Rose gave birth to Crowley's
            first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the
            pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his
            recuperating wife.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong> In November, Crowley and Jones decided to
            found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of
            the Golden Dawn, being aided in doing so by Fuller. The result was
            the A∴A∴.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> In November, Crowley and Neuburg travelled to
            Algeria, touring the desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and
            then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran on a daily basis.
            During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic,
            with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox
            as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic
            ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon
            involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed
            in his magical career
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1910</strong> Returning to London in January, Crowley found
            that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The
            Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1914</strong> In December he moved to New Orleans, his
            favourite US city, before spending February 1917 with evangelical
            Christian relatives in Titusville, Florida.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1920</strong> Crowley had ideas of forming a community of
            Thelemites, which he called the Abbey of Thelema after the Abbaye de
            Thélème in François Rabelais' satire Gargantua and Pantagruel. After
            consulting the I Ching, he chose Cefalù (on Sicily, Italy) as a
            location, and after arriving there, began renting the old Villa
            Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1923</strong> Crowley and Hirsig went to Tunis, where,
            dogged by continuing poor health, he unsuccessfully tried again to
            give up heroin, and began writing what he termed his
            "autohagiography", The Confessions of Aleister Crowley.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> In April 1930, Crowley moved to Berlin, where
            he took Hanni Jaegar as his magical partner; the relationship was
            troubled.In September he went to Lisbon in Portugal to meet the poet
            Fernando Pessoa. There, he decided to fake his own death, doing so
            with Pessoa's help at the Boca do Inferno rock formation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> On 1 December 1947, Crowley died at Netherwood
            of chronic bronchitis aggravated by pleurisy and myocardial
            degeneration, aged 72. His funeral was held at a Brighton
            crematorium on 5 December; about a dozen people attended, and Louis
            Wilkinson read excerpts from the Gnostic Mass, The Book of the Law,
            and "Hymn to Pan". The funeral generated press controversy, and was
            labelled a Black Mass by the tabloids. Crowley's ashes were sent to
            Karl Germer in the US, who buried them in his garden in Hampton, New
            Jersey.

          Into my loneliness comes— The sound of a flute in dim groves that
          haunt the uttermost hills. Even from the brave river they reach to the
          edge of the wilderness. And I behold Pan.
